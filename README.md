This is a chessgame with similar code to console-chess-game but using pygame and the assets i made for the game

I put this in a seperate repo because I still want the console chess game as it's own repo. I have added a function to check if the king on either team is in checkmate but it hasn't been tested or utilized yet

## Dependencies

- Python3 
- pygame
